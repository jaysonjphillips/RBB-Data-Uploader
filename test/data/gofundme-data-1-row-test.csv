She has put tens of thousands of miles on her personal vehicles transporting dogs and countless hours driving around looking for reported strays. She has spent many mornings and evenings before and after work feeding and exercising dogs at a local animal shelter for 3 years. Unfortunately 1 evening she didn't get off work until late. She went to take care of the dog's (up to 30) before she came home that night. On her way home at 11pm on a dark night farm to market road 2 black cattle ran out in front of her and totaled her vehicle. Of course with all the mileage she had put on it transporting adopted dogs across the country, the insurance company did not pay the full amount of what was still owed whic was $4,000. They only paid $1,600. We found a $3,000 car and they let us make payments on it fortunately because we had no money to put down on a vehicle. Within a short tme multiple things went wrong with this 2006 chevy cobalt. So far we've replaced the clutch, tie rods, and a few other minor things. Now the rack and pinion (controls steering) is going out and the struts need replacement, the catalytic converter and possibly sensors need replacement. We both work at Pizza Hut so you can imagine pay isn't that great. Her car is now unsafe to drive and we desperately need help to fix it. We are now down to one car and only 1 of us can obviously work. Please if any of you compassionate dog lovers (they actually rescue any animal needing help besides dogs) could help out we would be grateful beyond your imagination. Krystea is a hard working selfless woman who i wish i could give the world to. Please help, our goal is to raise $3,000 for repairs. As it is an older vehicle I'm certain other things will go wrong but we cannot afford a newer vehicle so we will happily settle for getting this one fixed.
